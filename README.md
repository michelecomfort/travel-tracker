# Travel Tracker

Turing School of Software & Design

2108 FEE, Mod 2 - Final Solo project

## Abstract
Travel Tracker is a web app that allows users to interact with a travel agent to view their trips both past and present, as well as book new trips. They have a single dashboard that they log into with their credentials which then allows them to browse through 50 destinations and decide if they want to request a new trip.

3. Users have the option to scroll through some photos of possible destinations towards the bottom. When they hover over an image, the location will appear underneath.
4. Users can then select a destination from a dropdown menu, enter a date of travel as well as the duration and amount of travelers they will have.
5. They will first see an estimate of their travel costs for that particular trip
6. If they choose to book the trip, they can click the 'book-it' button which will send the travel request to the local api for the travel agent
7. The page will immediately move to the user's pending trips section
